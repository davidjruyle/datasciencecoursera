##Data source

This dataset is taken from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Feature Selection

Please see the README.md and features.txt file in the original dataset to learn more about the feature selection for this dataset.

*The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).*

The assignment states "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement."

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

    tGravityAcc-XYZ
    tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    tBodyGyro-XYZ
    tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
    tBodyAccMag
    tGravityAccMag
    tBodyAccJerkMag
    tBodyGyroMag

    fBodyAcc-XYZ
    fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    fBodyGyro-XYZ
    fBodyAccMag
    fBodyAccJerkMag
    fBodyGyroMag
    fBodyGyroJerkMag

Variables from these signals are:

    mean():
    std(): Standard deviation


run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step can be found in averages_data.txt.
